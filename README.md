# Pandemic_Models
An educational standalone pandemic modelling app directed towards understanding the spread and control of SARS-CoV-2 (for Windows 10; will
install MATLAB Runtime)

This code allows the user to run numerical epidemic models in the SIR framework, along with perturbations such as varying death rates (vital 
dynamics), and timed quarantines. All model parameters are adjustable, though the default values for the base reproduction number and case fatality rate were taken from studies of SAR-CoV2 in late March 2020.

The default value for the quarantine end time in the second tab allows the user to see the risk of a second wave upon reopening. These model parameters are not meant to be realistic, but rather educational.

Models are based on those presented in the review article "The Mathematics of Infectious Diseases" by Herbert W. Hethcote: https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/S0036144500371907

This code was developed with the aid of students in Spring 2020 CHEM262 course (Mathematical Methods in the Chemical Sciences) at the 
University of Notre Dame.
